### Making Your First Contribution

* First off, if you don't have git set up on your machine, [install it here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

* Add your name and a little about yourself to this list :
    #### 1. Fork this repository

     Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.
     
   #### 2. Clone the repository
   
   Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon to copy the url of the repo. <br />

   Open your terminal and run the following git command:<br />
   `git clone <url you just copied>`

    For example: <br/>
    `git clone https://github.com/A-HK/Getting-Started-1.git`
    
    Remember to clone **your forked repository** , not the original one.

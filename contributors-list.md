Hey folks:wave:,
I'm Vedanth from DSU. **GitHub is my second home** and I love building projects that **solve real problems** and also love hackathons espicially the MLH ones. 
I also love building communities from the ground up and work on the side as a **Community Manager for 66daysofdata and Codebasics.** Currently I'm taking up the #100daysofcode challenge and excited to get started with open source. **Feel free to connect with me** on Twitter [@BaligaVedanth](https://twitter.com/BaligaVedanth) and LinkedIn [@vedanthvbaliga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vedanthbaliga/) <br />
